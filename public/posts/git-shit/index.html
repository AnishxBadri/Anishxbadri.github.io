        <p>On April 3rd, 2005, Linus Torvalds released a Linux kernel release candidate, 2.6.12-rc2. While the
release candidate itself was relatively unremarkable, consisting of just a few bug fixes, it became
significant for what it represented: the last Linux kernel release before the adoption of Git.</p>
<h2 id="stone-age-linus-as-a-version-control-service">
  Stone Age: Linus as a Version Control Service

    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>

  </a>
</h2>
<p>Initially, Linus-as-a-version-control-service, aka Linus himself, was the preferred version
control tool for the Linux kernel. Tarballs and patches would be sent by developers to a select
set of Linus&rsquo;s dependable lieutenants. The fixes that made it through the vetting process would
be forwarded to Linus. Ultimately, Linus would manually add them to his own source tree before
cutting the release.</p>
<p>While this manual workflow seems inhumane to us today, Linus at the time considered this woprkflow
to be superior to the altneratives namely CVS. No not the pharamacy you idiot. CVS (Concurrent
Versions System). It employed a centralized model, where a single repository stored all project
files and revbisions, allowing developer to check out, modiy and commit changes. Despite its
popularity, CVS had limitations, including difficulties with branching and merging, limited support
for dsitributewd development, and vulnerability to data corruption.</p>
<p>One of CVS&rsquo;s prominent critics was Linus himself. Linus believed that it was essential for every Linux developer to have a
separate, isolated copy of the repository so they could work on their own branches, considering
the large number of Linux developers worldwide. This made work easier offline and also helped with
internal politics, since each developer could submit anything they wanted to their own repository
and then had a chance to show the community that their modifications were worthwhile. This stopped
the single repository from being gatekeepered by a small group of authors with commit access.</p>

</h2>
<p>Enter Larry McVoy. Larry McVoy, founder of BitMover, <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/1998/9/30/122"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed BitKeeper to the Linux Community in
1998</a>. BitKeeper was radically different from any of its
contemporaries. In his pitch for BitKeeper, McVoy highlighted several key features that set it apart
and whose insipiration we can clearly see in Git:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Distributed Source Management:</p>
<ul>
<li>BitKeeper: Each user had their own repo, embracing a distrubuted model</li>
<li>Git: Git also follows a dsitributed model, where every user has a complete copy of the
repository, allowign for offline work and independent development.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change Sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>BitKeeper: Introduced comprehensive change sets, containing detailed information about
changes, their locations, revision history, and metadata.</li>
<li>Git: Git employs commits as its fundamental unit of change, which serve a familiar purpose to
BitKeeper&rsquo;s change sets. Commits in Git conrtain metadeta sucha as author ijnformation,
timestamps, coimmit messagfes and references to parent commits, provdiing a comprehensive
record of changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Line of Development (LOD):</p>
<ul>
<li>BitKeeper: Introduced the cocnept of LODs, which fuunctioned as flexible branches that didn&rsquo;t
necessarily need to explicitly be created.</li>
<li>Git: LOD&rsquo;s are just like Git branches bnut with bnetter branching and merging capabilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>It always amazes me how two era-defining technologies, JavaScript and Git, were written in about 2
weeks. While git is a work of art, Javascript in my opinion, is a cesspool of dog shit.
Javascript was written in about 10 days, and it shows. Maybe if Brandon Eich spent the entirety
of two weeks he could have come up with something better, but I digress.</p>
